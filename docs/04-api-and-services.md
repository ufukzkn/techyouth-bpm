# API And Services

## Auth

- `POST /api/auth/login`
  - Validates username/password.
  - Returns a token-like session value and user profile.
- `GET /api/auth/me`
  - Reads the current session.
  - Returns active user information.

## Forms

- `GET /api/forms`
  - Lists saved form definitions.
- `POST /api/forms`
  - Creates a form definition with fields and validation rules.
- `GET /api/forms/{id}`
  - Returns a single form definition.

## Processes

- `POST /api/processes/start`
  - Validates submitted form data.
  - Stores JSON submission data.
  - Creates a process instance.
  - Creates the first task.
- `GET /api/processes`
  - Lists processes visible to the active user.
- `GET /api/processes/{id}`
  - Returns process status, dates, form data, tasks and audit history.

## Tasks

- `GET /api/tasks/my`
  - Lists tasks assigned to the current user or role.
- `POST /api/tasks/{id}/actions`
  - Runs an action such as approve or reject.
  - Updates process status through the state machine.
  - Writes an audit log entry.

## Swagger Usage

Swagger is available in development at `/swagger`.

Most endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Use `POST /api/auth/login` first, copy the returned token, then click `Authorize` in Swagger and paste the token. Swagger adds the bearer header to protected requests after authorization.

## Service Responsibility

Controllers should stay thin. Services own decisions:

- `AuthService`: login/session/user lookup.
- `FormService`: form definition CRUD and field validation.
- `ProcessService`: process start, detail and listing.
- `TaskService`: task listing and action execution.
- `ProcessStateMachine`: allowed transitions.
- `DatabaseSeeder`: local demo users and optional mock workflow data.

## Frontend Client Coverage

The frontend API client now exposes one method for each planned endpoint:

- Auth: `login`, `me`
- Forms: `listForms`, `createForm`, `getForm`
- Processes: `startProcess`, `listProcesses`, `getProcess`
- Tasks: `listMyTasks`, `executeTaskAction`

Feature components should call these client methods through feature-level orchestration instead of calling `fetch` directly.

## Implemented Backend Structure

- `TechYouthBpm.Domain`: entities and enums.
- `TechYouthBpm.Application`: DTOs, service interfaces and `ProcessStateMachine`.
- `TechYouthBpm.Infrastructure`: EF Core `AppDbContext`, SQLite/PostgreSQL provider setup, seed data and service implementations.
- `TechYouthBpm.Api`: controllers, Swagger, CORS and startup database seeding.

The API accepts the session token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Enum values are returned as readable strings, for example `Admin`, `InProgress` and `Approve`. This keeps the frontend role checks and status displays explicit.

Task actions load the task and parent process, validate role/action, update process status through `ProcessStateMachine`, and then write a separate `AuditLog` row. The detail response is reloaded from the database after save so UI state reflects persisted data, not a temporary in-memory object graph.

## Database Configuration

The API reads `Database:Provider` from configuration:

- `Sqlite`: default local mode, using `Data Source=techyouth-bpm.db`.
- `PostgreSql`: shared database mode, intended for Neon or another PostgreSQL host.

The connection string is read from `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection`. Real PostgreSQL credentials must be supplied through environment variables or .NET user secrets. Tracked documentation and config files only contain examples.

Local SQLite setup, current schema summary and reset/start commands are documented in `docs/08-local-database.md`. Any schema, seed data or local startup change should update that document and `scripts/run-api-local.ps1`.

The local startup script enables `Seed__MockData=true` by default. This adds two form definitions, football-themed process submissions, open approver tasks and completed/rejected audit examples. Use `-SkipMockData` when a teammate needs a nearly empty local database.
